# employee-future-prediction
This project was one of my first ever projects on Data Science. It was created as an assignement for the course " Management Information Systems" instructed by Pr. Karakapilidis Nikos at the University of Patras.

Problem's Description:

A company's executive members want to be able to know which employees are expected to leave the company in the next 2 years. This knowledge will help them take important decisions such as recruitment of new employees or providing more assets and wage to the employees that they want to keep. Machine Learning and Deep Learning make this task possible.

An extended presentation of the code is showcased in the following youtube video (greek language) --->

The dataset used to train the models is not owned by me. It can be found on Kaggle at the following link --->
